    <p>
        Hello! My name is Matthew Miller and I am one of the founders of ChartBulls. 
        I wanted to take a second and say hello and welcome you to ChartBulls. 
        Seriously, on behalf of the company, I want you to know we are pumped you are here with us.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Here's what you can expect from us... </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        We will be sending out updates leading up to the official launch. 
        We will also send you general financial info to help you become financially free and 
        manage your money to help you achieve your goals.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once our site is live, we will send out a notice to you so that you can start using it right away!  
        <br>
        <br>
        <i> Sound fair?? </i>
        <br>
        <b> Good! :) </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i> Here's what you need to do now to get started... </i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Make sure you are getting our emails! </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Whitelist and prioritize all emails from "ChartBulls" and "Matthew Miller".
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> This is important! </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        If our emails aren't getting through, you won't know when you will be able to get into the site. 
        Doing this will give the smoothest transition into using ChartBulls. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Make sure to prioritize our emails if you are using gmail and whitelist our emails 
        if you are using another provider. 
        Also, make a special folder called "ChartBulls" that you can store all of our emails in for future use.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are looking forward to helping you Know Your Worth!
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
